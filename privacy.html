    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>reloo</strong> (the <strong>"Application"</strong>)
      collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Application.
      The Application is provided by <strong>Francisco Quezada</strong> (the <strong>"Service Provider"</strong>).
    </p>

    <p class="box">
      <strong>Summary:</strong> We collect only the information needed to operate the Application,
      including account sign-in identifiers (Apple/Google), optional profile information, event content you submit
      (including photos), approximate or precise location (if you grant permission), and purchase status for in-app purchases.
      We use third-party services such as Supabase (backend/storage), Mapbox (maps), Apple/Google (sign-in),
      and Apple App Store / Google Play (payments).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

        You may also provide optional profile details (e.g., display name).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User-generated content:</strong> When you create events, you may submit text, dates/times, locations,
        links, and <strong>photos/images</strong>. This content is stored so it can be displayed in the Application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support communications:</strong> If you contact us, we may collect the information you include in your message.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location information (with permission):</strong> If you grant location permission, we may collect
        approximate or precise location to show nearby events and improve map-based features. You can disable location access
        at any time in your device settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device and usage information:</strong> We may collect basic device information (e.g., device model, OS version)
        and usage data necessary for performance and troubleshooting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Push notification token (optional):</strong> If you enable notifications, we may collect a device push token to
        send notifications. You can disable notifications in your device settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Purchase status:</strong> If you make an in-app purchase, we may store purchase/subscription status (e.g., active/inactive)
        to enable paid features. We do not collect or store full payment card details.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>Improve performance, fix bugs, and maintain security.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you when you contact support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>

      comply with law, or protect rights and safety.
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Service providers and platforms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apple and Google (Sign-In):</strong> We use Apple/Google authentication to allow you to sign in.
        These providers process authentication according to their own policies.

      The Application is not intended for children under 14 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
