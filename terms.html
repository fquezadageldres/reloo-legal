    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

    <p>
      These Terms and Conditions apply to the <strong>reloo</strong> mobile application (the
      <strong>&quot;Application&quot;</strong>) provided by <strong>Francisco Quezada</strong>
      (the <strong>&quot;Service Provider&quot;</strong>) as a commercial / freemium service.
    </p>

    <p>
      By downloading, accessing, or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.
      If you do not agree, please do not use the Application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Use of the Application</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to use the Application only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.
      You are responsible for your conduct and any content you submit, post, or display through the Application.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or the Service Provider’s trademarks
      is prohibited. You may not attempt to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages,
      or create derivative versions. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to
      the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts and Sign-In</h2>
    <p>
      The Application may allow you to sign in using third-party identity providers (e.g., Apple or Google).
      Your use of those providers is subject to their terms and policies. The Service Provider is not responsible for
      third-party authentication services.
    </p>

    <h2>4. User-Generated Content (Events, Text, Photos, Links)</h2>
    <p>
      The Application operates as a digital bulletin board for publishing and discovering event listings.
      Event listings, descriptions, images/photos, locations, dates, prices, and links may be provided by users or other third parties
      (<strong>&quot;User Content&quot;</strong>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>You are solely responsible</strong> for the User Content you create, upload, publish, or share through the Application.
      You represent and warrant that: (a) you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to submit the User Content;
      (b) your User Content does not infringe any third-party rights (including copyright, privacy, or publicity rights);
      and (c) your User Content complies with applicable laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>License to the Service Provider:</strong> By submitting User Content, you grant the Service Provider a non-exclusive,
      worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host, store, reproduce, display, and distribute your User Content
      solely for the purpose of operating, improving, and promoting the Application (including displaying your event listings to other users).
      You can remove your User Content by deleting it within the Application (where available), although copies may persist for a limited time
      in backups or caches.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Content and Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      You agree not to post or share User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, misleading, defamatory, harassing, hateful,
      pornographic, or otherwise objectionable, or that promotes illegal activities. You also agree not to upload viruses, malware,
      or any code designed to disrupt or damage the Application or other users.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Service Provider may (but is not obligated to) remove or restrict access to User Content at any time, for any reason,
      including if the Service Provider believes it violates these Terms or applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Events Disclaimer (No Endorsement / No Verification)</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider does not organize, guarantee, or endorse any listed events and is not required to verify the accuracy,
      quality, safety, legality, or availability of any event or related information. Any interaction, agreement, or transaction
      related to an event takes place solely between the user and the relevant organizer/provider.
    </p>

    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service Provider shall not be liable for any damages, losses, fraud,
      incidents, injuries, cancellations, changes, errors, or other issues arising from attending, participating in, or relying on
      events published in the Application.
    </p>

    <h2>7. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The Application may offer in-app purchases and/or subscriptions. Payments are processed by the app store platform
      (Apple App Store and/or Google Play). The Service Provider does not collect or store full payment card details.
      The Application may store purchase/subscription status to enable paid features.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Service Changes and Availability</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. The Service Provider
      reserves the right to modify the Application, add or remove features, or charge for services at any time and for any reason.
      Any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data). The Service Provider is not responsible
      if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi/data, limited bandwidth, or if you have exhausted
      your data allowance.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider’s terms still apply. You may incur charges from your
      mobile provider for data usage or roaming. You accept responsibility for any such charges.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Device Security</h2>
    <p>
      It is your responsibility to keep your device secure and to maintain control of access to the Application. The Service Provider
      recommends that you do not jailbreak or root your device. Such actions may expose your device to malware or compromise security features
      and may cause the Application to malfunction.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      While the Service Provider strives to keep the Application updated and accurate, the Application may contain errors or outdated information,
      and the Service Provider may rely on third parties to provide certain information. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service Provider
      accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying on the Application.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider may cease providing the Application and may terminate or suspend your access at any time without notice.
      Upon termination: (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these Terms will end; (b) you must stop using the Application; and
      (c) if necessary, delete it from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for changes.
      Continued use of the Application after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
